# PerceptronAdaline

The problem consists of solving a classification problem using a Simple Perceptron and an Adaline. A two-dimensional training data must be generated within the rectangle [0, 10] x [0, 10] and the points must be labeled according to their position with respect to a line y = mx + b that also passes through the rectangle. Points above the line will be labeled as 1, and points below will be labeled as -1. Then, it is desired to train a Simple Perceptron and an Adaline to correctly classify the randomly generated test points.
